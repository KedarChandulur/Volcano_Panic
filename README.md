# Volcano_Panic
This is a University project. Course number - GAM 440(Games with a purpose)

Game engine used: Unity.
Programming language used: C#

Game instruction and controls are mentioned inside the game, under options menu(In main menu screen).

I have used Navigation mesh, Singleton(For GameManager) and EventHandlers to make the game work.



# Additional Info:
This game is the first of three I created as part of a course during my master's program.

For the design of Volcano Panic, I utilized the Triadic Game Design framework to achieve a balance between the World of Reality, the World of Meaning, and the World of Play.

The programming was done in Unity using C#, following SOLID principles and incorporating various software design patterns.

I employed the Singleton design pattern for the managers and used events to manage most of the game's functionality.

For vehicle navigation, I have used Unity's NavMesh system.

To handle common functionalities like hostage pick-up and rescue destinations, I employed inheritance.

The game features a freeform camera that adapts based on whether it is attached to the player or not.
